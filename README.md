# Pomodoro-Timer
A little timer made with Python and Tkinter. A little helper to remember to get up and drink water during work.  Still in the making.

# Usage
Run the main.py, make sure the pictures are in the same dir than the scripts and enter the time in min.
After each timer the picture will change and a text "Drink some water" will appear, to remind you to drink water.
A cute helper to check your water intake :D Also helps to take breaks during work.

# Requirements
Tkinter and Pillow need to be downloaded with pip first
